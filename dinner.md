  | Ingredients |  
  | ---      |
  | 1 cup basmati rice | 
  | 1 cup coconut milk |
  | 1/2 red onion |
  | 1/4 cup hazelnuts |
  | 1 cup broccolini (chopped) |
  | 1 tbsp coconut oil |
  | 1 cup canned chickpeas |
  | 1/2 tbsp garlic powder |
  | 1 tsp chili powder |
  | 1 tbsp smoked paprika |
  | 2 tsp turmeric |
  | generous pinch of salt | 
  | 1/2 cup shredded coconut |
  | few sprigs cilantro |
  
  
  > Directions:  
  > 1. Place 1 cup of basmati rice into a small sauce pan.  Wash and drain the rice a couple of times to get rid of the excess starch
  > 2. Toast the rice for a couple of minutes on medium high heat.  Then, add in 1 cup of coconut milk
  > 3. When the milk starts to bubble, give the rice a good stir to make sure nothing is grabbing the bottom of the pan.  Then, cover and cook on medium low for 15min
  > 4. Dice the red onion, coarsely chop the hazelnuts, and chop the broccolini
  > 5. After 15min, turn the heat off and let the rice steam further for 10min
  > 6. Heat up a non stick pan on medium heat.  Add the coconut oil
  > 7. Add the red onion and chickpeas followed by the garlic powder, chili powder, smoked paprika, turmeric, and salt
  > 8. Add in the hazelnuts and broccolini
  > 9. Sauté for 3-4min
  > 10. Add the shredded coconut.  Sauté for another couple of minutes and taste and adjust the seasoning if needed
  > 11. Plate the rice and add the coconut chickpeas on top.  Garnish with some freshly chopped cilantro
